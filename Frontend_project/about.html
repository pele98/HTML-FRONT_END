            <p style="margin-left: 110px;">
              Fake band - founded in early 2015, is a fake band for a website
              project. We are a group of 5 friends, interested in music and we
              do varieties of different music, our own as well as covers.<br />

            <h4>Guitarist</h4>
            <p style="margin-right: 130px;">
              Our guitarist, Kermit the frog, has been with the band since the
              beginning. He has been playing guitar all his life and is loved
              for his jumping of roofs stunts on stage.<br />

            <h4>Basists</h4>
            <p style="margin-left: 110px;">
              Harambe has been our bass player since 2017, after his retirement
              from a local zoo. She also helps the bandmates with the stage
              arrangements and she loves going around the crowd and holding our
              fans childs.<br />
            </p>

            <h4>Drummer</h4>
            <p style="margin-right: 130px;">
              Our drummer, Elmo, is a valuable resource for the band. Besides
              his drumming skills, he can keep an eye on the crowd, due to his
              super sized eyes. He also has a unique drumset, which includes all
              normal drum equipment as well as some thrash cans.<br />

            <h4>Singer</h4>
            <p style="margin-left: 110px;">
              Little My was our obvious choice for the singes. She capsulates
              everyone with her angelic voice, and is totally tall enough to
              reach the microphone.<br />
            </p>

          <div

            <h4>5th instrument and back-up singer</h4>
            <p style="margin-right: 130px;">
              The bands secret weapon is our multitalented back-up singer, Peppa
              the pig. She can play any instrument that we need and is big (7'1)
              and strong enough to also work as our security officer.<br />
